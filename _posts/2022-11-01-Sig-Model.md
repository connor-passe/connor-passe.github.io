# Signal Propagation Surrogate Modeling



### Background / Motivation:
I was interested in exploring the feasibility of performing signal propagation modeling on a mobile device. While signal propagation modeling is not a new field (it dates back to the 1950â€™s), the concept of doing so accurately and in a computationally-constrained environment is fairly novel. Most simulation packages are firmly focused on accuracy above all else and can only be run in a dedicated desktop environment. I was interested in developing an application that could do the following:
