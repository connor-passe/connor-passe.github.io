![handsome picture of myself](/assets/images/me.jpeg){: style="float: left"}

I'm a software engineer based in Durham, North Carolina who's led teams to develope machine learning algorithms for the Department of Defense, design integrated surgical tools for eye surgery, and retool databases for a private jet company.

With a formal education in Mechanical Engineering and a passion for software, I have a strong math background and experience developing in Java, Python, Swift, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and MATLAB. 

In my free time you can find me playing basketball, SCUBA diving, surfing, and watching Duke Basketball beat UNC.
